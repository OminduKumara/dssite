Scenario:
You are required to design and implement a prototype for a simplified Distributed Payment Processing System used by an e-commerce platform. The system should support multiple clients performing payment transactions concurrently, ensuring that all payments are recorded correctly and consistently even in the presence of node failures or network delays. The historical payment details should be accessible from any server to any client. 

 
Tasks:
Divide the tasks among the 4 team members, ensuring collaboration and integration of all components. Each member will focus on one core aspect of the system, but the team must work together to ensure the system functions as a whole.
1. Fault Tolerance (Member 1):
Objective: Ensure the system continues functioning even in case of failures.
Tasks:
- Implement redundancy mechanisms across multiple servers.
- Design a failure detection system to identify when a payment server node becomes unavailable.
- Develop an automatic failover mechanism to redirect payments in case of server failures.
- Propose a recovery mechanism for nodes that rejoin the system.
- Evaluate the impact of redundancy on system performance and storage overhead.
2. Data Replication and Consistency (Member 2):
Objective: Ensure payment details (ledger) are replicated across multiple nodes while maintaining consistency and availability.
Tasks:
- Design a replication strategy (e.g., quorum-based, primary-backup, or sharding).
- Choose a consistency model (e.g., strong consistency, eventual consistency) and justify the trade-offs.
- Implement a deduplication mechanism to handle duplicates caused by retries or failovers.
- Optimize payment performance while ensuring consistency across servers.
- Analyze how replication impacts latency and storage efficiency.
3. Time Synchronization (Member 3):
Objective: Ensure payment details have accurate timestamps for event correlation and debugging across distributed servers.
Tasks:
- Implement a time synchronization protocol (e.g., NTP, PTP) across all logging nodes.
- Analyze the impact of clock skew on log ordering and consistency.
- Develop a mechanism to reorder logs that arrive out of sequence due to network delays.
- Implement log timestamp correction techniques to ensure event accuracy.
- Evaluate the trade-offs between synchronization accuracy and system overhead.
4. Consensus and Agreement Algorithms (Member 4):
Objective: Ensure distributed payment servers agree on log storage, indexing, and retrieval policies.
Tasks:
- Research and implement a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) for distributed payment consistency.
- Design a leader election mechanism to manage payment coordination.
- Evaluate the performance of the consensus algorithm under high payment processing rates.
- Propose optimizations to reduce consensus overhead while ensuring consistency.
- Test the system under different failure scenarios (network partitions, node crashes).

Deliverables:
1. Report:
   - A detailed report (10-12 pages) explaining the design choices, log replication strategies, and system optimizations.
2. Implementation:
   - A working prototype of the distributed logging system using Python, Java, or Go.
3. Presentation:
   - A 15-minute presentation explaining the architecture, implementation, and evaluation.
4. Code:
 - Github link to the code in a text file. 
5. Presentation video:
 - Link to the Youtube video with the presentation.  

Evaluation Criteria:
Criteria	Weight	Description
Fault Tolerance	20%	Effectiveness of failure detection, log redundancy, and recovery mechanisms.
Data Replication	20%	Efficiency of log replication, consistency guarantees, and retrieval speed.
Time Synchronization	20%	Accuracy of timestamps and resolution of out-of-order log events.
Consensus & Agreement	20%	Reliability and efficiency of the consensus algorithm for log coordination.
Overall Integration	20%	Seamless operation of all components and scalability of the system.

      <h3>Copilot Analysis — Workspace Mapping & Techniques</h3>

          <div id="a-copilot" class="acc-body">
<pre class="chat">
Below is a concise mapping from your workspace code to the requested techniques, with exact symbol/file links you can open.

1) Fault Tolerance (Member 1)
- Techniques used
  - Redundancy via multiple servers registered as ZooKeeper ephemeral sequential nodes: see `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer`.
  - Failure detection via ZooKeeper watches on `/payment/nodes`: see `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentClient.watchNodes` and the watch handler in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer`.
  - Liveness probe via direct TCP connect for fast health checks: `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager.isAlive`.
  - Automatic failover in client logic: client prefers leader then iterates fallback nodes on failure: `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentClient.sendPayment`.
  - Recovery on rejoin: server re-registers a new ephemeral sequential znode on start and leader/follower catch-up logic attempts to sync missing WAL entries: see registration in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer` and catch-up code `followerCatchup` which uses `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager.fetchWalFrom` and ledger apply `payment.datareplication.Ledger.appendFollower`.
- Notes / evaluation
  - ZooKeeper ephemeral nodes provide robust membership/failure signals (low false positives) but require a running ZooKeeper ensemble.
  - Redundancy adds network/CPU overhead (more replication traffic) and storage overhead (each node stores full ledger/WAL). Snapshot/WAL rotation mitigates unbounded WAL growth: see `payment.datareplication.Ledger.maybeSnapshot`.

2) Data Replication and Consistency (Member 2)
- Strategy implemented
  - Primary-backup leader-based synchronous fan-out replication: leader applies locally then calls `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager.replicateAndCount` to send `REPLSEQ` to followers. Leader detection uses lexicographic znode order in `/payment/nodes`: see `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager.getLeaderNode` and leader selection in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer.updateLeaderStatus`.
- Consistency model & trade-offs
  - Implementation favors strong consistency (leader waits for follower ACKs before committing in PaymentServer): see quorum logic in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer.handleClient` -> replicateAndCount usage. Quorum used in code is computed as majority: $ \\text{needed} = \\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\rfloor + 1 $ (implemented as `total / 2 + 1`).
  - Trade-off: strong consistency -> higher write latency and lower availability under follower failures; majority/quorum formula: $$\\text{quorum} = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor + 1$$
  - Latency approx: $$L \\approx L_{\\text{local}} + \\max_i(\\text{RTT}_i + L_{\\text{follower\\_apply}})$$ (leader waits on slowest follower).
- Deduplication
  - Idempotency keys persisted in ids.txt and in-memory map `entries` used to skip duplicates: see `payment.datareplication.Ledger.appendLeader` and `payment.datareplication.Ledger.appendFollower`.
- Performance optimizations present / possible
  - Present: WAL + ledger append with durable fsync per-entry and WAL snapshot rotation: `Ledger`.
  - Suggested: switch to majority quorum (already used) or configurable quorum, batch replication, async replication with durable local commit + background replication to reduce latency (code currently does synchronous fan-out).
- Storage impact
  - Each node stores full WAL, ledger and ids; snapshot/truncation in `Ledger.maybeSnapshot` reduces long-term storage.

3) Time Synchronization (Member 3)
- Techniques implemented
  - Lightweight SNTP-like offset estimation: `payment.timesync.TimeSync` computes serverTime − localTime (ms).
  - Log buffering & reordering based on corrected timestamps: `payment.timesync.LogReorderer` and entry type `payment.timesync.LogEntry`.
  - PaymentServer uses TimeSync + LogReorderer to periodically flush ordered logs to disk: see creation and periodic flush in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer`.
- Impact analysis & mechanism
  - Clock skew affects log order; LogReorderer corrects timestamps using offset and buffers events in a window (configurable `windowMs`) to emit in corrected order — reduces misordering due to small skew or network delay.
  - Trade-offs: single-sample SNTP is low overhead but noisy; higher accuracy requires multiple samples or running system NTP/PTP.
- Improvements to consider
  - Run host NTP/chrony (recommended in README), use multi-sample SNTP with min-RTT selection or implement hybrid logical clocks (HLC) for causal ordering when correctness matters.

4) Consensus and Agreement Algorithms (Member 4)
- Implementations in workspace
  - Simulated in-process Raft: `payment.consensus.RaftNode` implements election, heartbeats, in-memory log replication and `RaftLogEntry` `payment.consensus.RaftLogEntry`. Example harness and UI integration: `payment.consensus.RaftHarness` and GUI `payment.TestControlPanel`.
  - ZooKeeper-based leader election (production-ish): PaymentServer uses lexicographically smallest znode under `/payment/nodes` as leader (simple leader selection) — see `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer.updateLeaderStatus`.
- Observations & evaluation
  - Raft simulation provides basic leader election, heartbeats, and replication but is in-memory (no durable log) and not networked; good for correctness experiments but not production-grade.
  - For production, use a persistent Raft implementation or rely on ZooKeeper/etcd for coordination + a durable replication protocol.
  - Under high rate, consensus overhead grows with replication and synchronous commits; optimizations: batching, pipeline replication, leader leases, or using faster RPC and connection pooling.
- Failure testing
  - The harness and GUI permit crash/recover simulation (`RaftHarness` and `TestControlPanel`), but real network partitions are not modeled. Extend tests to simulate partitions, message delays and disk failures.

Files / symbols to open (quick links)
- Fault tolerance & server/client: `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer`, `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentClient`
- Replication & ledger: `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager`, `payment.datareplication.Ledger`
- Time sync & reordering: `payment.timesync.TimeSync`, `payment.timesync.LogReorderer`, `payment.timesync.LogEntry`
- Consensus simulation & UI: `payment.consensus.RaftNode`, `payment.consensus.RaftLogEntry`, `payment.consensus.RaftHarness`, `payment.TestControlPanel`
- Design notes / overview: README.md

If you want, I can:
- produce a short design patch to switch replication to majority quorum only, or
- add a multi-sample SNTP loop to TimeSync, or
- persist Raft logs to disk for durable consensus.

Which of those would you like implemented?

Summary — Member 1 (Fault Tolerance)
- Role: design and implement mechanisms so the payment system continues operating despite node crashes, process failures, or transient network issues.
- Primary responsibilities:
  - Redundancy: run multiple payment server instances and ensure clients can reach alternatives.
  - Failure detection: detect unavailable nodes quickly and accurately.
  - Automatic failover: redirect client requests to healthy servers when a node fails.
  - Recovery: bring rejoining nodes up-to-date and reintegrate them safely.
  - Evaluation: measure the performance and storage cost of redundancy and produce recommendations.

What the code currently implements (files to inspect)
- Node registration & ephemeral membership: PaymentServer.java
- Client discovery & failover logic: PaymentClient.java
- Watcher for membership changes: NodeWatcher.java
- Liveness probe used by replication: ReplicationManager.java
- Follower catch-up (WAL fetch): ReplicationManager.java and Ledger.java

Techniques used (brief)
- Membership via ZooKeeper ephemeral znodes (fast, reliable failure signals).
- Leader selection by lexicographic znode ordering (simple leader election).
- Client-side automatic failover: clients prefer leader then iterate fallbacks on failure.
- Health checks: TCP/connect probes for quick liveness detection.
- Recovery: re-register ephemeral node on restart + follower catch-up using WAL fetch and ledger apply.
- Durability: WAL + snapshot rotation to limit storage growth.

Tasks to complete / recommended improvements
- Harden failure detection:
  - Add multi-probe health checks (HTTP + TCP) and configurable timeouts.
  - Debounce flapping with failure windows to reduce false failovers.
- Improve failover reliability:
  - Move failover decision to coordination service / consensus (avoid split-brain client heuristics).
  - Provide transparent proxy or client library that retries and preserves idempotency.
- Recovery and catch-up:
  - Make follower catch-up idempotent and handle divergent histories (conflict resolution).
  - Add snapshot transfer for large WAL gaps.
- Measurement & evaluation:
  - Add benchmarks: write latency, throughput vs. N replicas, and storage per node over time.
  - Report CPU/network/storage overhead for 1, 3, 5 node clusters.
- Testing:
  - Automated scripts to start a 3-node cluster + ZooKeeper, inject failures (stop process, kill TCP, etc.), and validate no lost/duplicated payments.
  - Add unit tests for rejoin/catch-up paths and for failover correctness.

Deliverables Member 1 should produce
- Short design doc (2–3 pages) describing detection, failover and recovery mechanisms and trade-offs.
- Scripts: start-cluster.bat, stop-cluster.bat, fault-inject.bat for Windows.
- Automated integration test that demonstrates: leader failure -> clients succeed via failover -> failed node rejoins and catches up.
- Measured results: latency and storage overhead tables + brief interpretation.

If you want, I can generate:
- a starter failure-injection script to run on Windows that launches 3 servers and kills one, or
- a 2–3 page fault-tolerance design note drafted from code and recommended improvements.

<pre class="chat">
Goal (plain language)
- Ensure every payment is recorded on multiple servers so data survives node failures, and make sure all nodes agree on what payments exist (no lost or conflicting records).

High level idea
- One server (the leader) accepts writes and replicates them to followers.
- The leader writes a durable record (WAL) locally, sends the record to followers, waits for enough acknowledgements (a quorum/majority), then marks the record committed and reports success to the client.
- To avoid duplicates when clients retry, the system records idempotency keys and skips already-applied payments.

How the current code implements these ideas (step-by-step, easy)
1. Client -> Leader
   - Client discovers nodes (PaymentClient) and sends the payment to the leader (PaymentServer). If leader fails, client falls back to other nodes.

2. Leader write-ahead log (WAL)
   - Leader appends the payment entry and idempotency key to the WAL on disk (Ledger.appendLeader) so the write is durable even if the leader crashes immediately after.

3. Replication to followers
   - Leader calls ReplicationManager.replicateAndCount (fan-out RPCs) to send the WAL entry to followers.
   - The leader waits until a quorum (majority) of nodes have acknowledged before marking the entry committed. This gives strong consistency (once committed, any majority can serve reads and see the entry).

4. Commit & apply
   - Once quorum is reached, the leader applies the entry to the local ledger state and answers the client with success.
   - Followers persist entries they receive (Ledger.appendFollower) and will apply them when they learn the commit index.

5. Deduplication
   - Each payment includes an idempotency key or unique payment id.
   - Ledger persists seen ids (data/ids.txt and in-memory map) and skips applying duplicates on replays or retries.

6. Follower catch-up
   - If a follower is behind, it fetches missing WAL entries from another node (ReplicationManager.fetchWalFrom) and replays them.

Files to open and what to look for
- Ledger.java — WAL append, snapshot rotation, ids dedup map.
- ReplicationManager.java — replicateAndCount, follower liveness checks, WAL fetch.
- PaymentServer.java — where replication is invoked and commit/quorum logic is used.
- PaymentClient.java — how clients retry and choose servers.

Simple concrete example — one successful payment write
1. Client sends payment {id: "p123", amount: 10} to leader.
2. Leader: Ledger.appendLeader("p123") -> write to WAL + fsync.
3. Leader: ReplicationManager.replicateAndCount -> send to followers and wait for majority (total/2 + 1).
4. When quorum acked, leader marks committed and applies to ledger state.
5. Client receives success. If the leader crashed after step 2 but before step 4, followers or a new leader can finish commit via catch-up or replay.

Example duplicate prevention case
- Client retries the same payment id "p123" after a timeout.
- When server receives retry, Ledger checks ids map or ids file; if "p123" already committed, server returns success without inserting a new ledger entry.

What to test (beginner test ideas)
- Dedup test: send same payment id multiple times; check ledger contains only one record.
- Quorum test: start 3 servers, kill one follower, send writes — ensure writes still succeed (majority = 2).
- Leader crash test: kill leader after WAL append but before commit, bring a new leader up and verify the payment is committed exactly once.
- Latency vs replicas: measure write latency for 1, 3, 5 replicas (simple stopwatch around client call).

Common limitations in the current prototype (what you should know)
- The code uses leader-based synchronous replication (strong consistency) which increases write latency because the leader waits for follower ACKs.
- Replication is fan-out synchronous; batching is not implemented (so many small writes are slower).
- Follower catch-up is implemented but conflict resolution for divergent logs is basic — a full Raft-style commit log would be stronger.
- Storage: each node stores full WAL and ledger; snapshots truncate logs but you should measure disk usage for your workload.

Improvements you can request / ask me to generate
- A unit test that verifies deduplication (JUnit) for Ledger.appendLeader/appendFollower.
- A small patch to enforce strict majority quorum behavior or to add batching to ReplicationManager.
- A script to start 3 servers and run the quorum/leader-crash tests on Windows.
- A short note comparing strong vs eventual consistency with trade-offs (1 page).

      <h3>Member 3 — Time Synchronization (Beginner-Friendly)</h3>
      <p class="lead">How timestamps are aligned, log reorder, tests and improvements.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="acc-item">
          <div class="acc-head" onclick="toggleAcc('m3-full')">
            <h4>⏱ Member 3 — Full Explanation (click to expand)</h4>
            <div class="tag">TimeSync & Reorder</div>
          </div>
          <div id="m3-full" class="acc-body">
<pre class="chat">
Goal (plain language)
- Make timestamps on payment events accurate and comparable across servers so you can order events, debug, and correlate activity across machines.

High-level idea
- Each server estimates the offset between its local clock and a reference (another server or time source).
- When events are logged, the server corrects timestamps using that offset.
- Because network delays cause logs to arrive out of order, buffer recent log entries in a reorderer and emit them in corrected chronological order.
- Trade-offs: better accuracy needs more network/time-sampling work and adds latency/CPU.

How the current code implements this (step-by-step, simple)
1. Estimate clock offset
   - TimeSync performs a light SNTP-like exchange to estimate offset = (remoteTime − localTime) and stores it (single-sample or periodic).
   - Look for sampling, offset calculation and any RTT measurement in TimeSync.

2. Correct timestamps on events
   - When a payment or log entry is created or received, the code applies the offset to compute a corrected timestamp (serverTime + offset).

3. Buffer and reorder logs
   - LogReorderer buffers incoming LogEntry objects for a configurable window (windowMs).
   - Entries are emitted in corrected timestamp order after the window delay to allow late/slow messages to arrive in-order.

4. Periodic flush and persistence
   - PaymentServer uses TimeSync + LogReorderer to flush ordered, corrected logs to ledger or disk at intervals.

What to read in the code (files and what to look for)
- TimeSync.java — SNTP-like offset sampling, how often it samples, how it handles failures.
- LogEntry.java — fields for raw and corrected timestamps.
- LogReorderer.java — buffer logic, windowMs, eviction, emission policy.
- PaymentServer.java — how TimeSync and LogReorderer are used in the processing pipeline.

Simple concrete example (what happens to one out-of-order event)
- Server A creates event at local time tA.
- A’s TimeSync offset = -50 ms, so corrected timestamp = tA - 50 ms.
- Server B receives network delivery later with local corrected timestamp tB_corr which is earlier than A’s uncorrected times; LogReorderer buffers both entries and emits them in order by corrected timestamp once the window expires, preserving global ordering.

Beginner Windows commands to check/observe time sync (useful before running the app)
- Query offset against a public NTP server (sample 5 times):
    w32tm /stripchart /computer:time.windows.com /samples:5 /dataonly

- Check local Windows time service status:
    w32tm /query /status

Simple tests / experiments you can run (easy)
- Reorder simulation: send two log entries from different servers with artificially created timestamps (or delay sending one) and observe ledger order after windowMs flush.
- Skew sensitivity: modify TimeSync to add a fake bias (e.g., offset += 200 ms) and see how ordering changes.
- Window size test: try windowMs = 50, 200, 1000 ms and measure how many out-of-order events are fixed vs how much extra latency is added.

Limitations in the current prototype (what to expect)
- TimeSync may be single-sample or low-sample -> noisy offsets and transient errors.
- SNTP-like sampling is lower accuracy than PTP or OS-level NTP; residual skew can remain.
- LogReorderer adds buffering delay (windowMs) which increases end-to-end latency.
- Causality: timestamp correction + reorder does not provide causal guarantees (use HLC or vector clocks if causal ordering is required).

Practical improvements (ranked, simple to implement → advanced)
- Multi-sample SNTP: take N samples and use the sample with min-RTT to reduce noise.
- Periodic resampling and smoothing (exponential moving average) to avoid jumps.
- Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC): cheaply combine physical time with logical counters for causal ordering without global perfect sync.
- Snapshot of offset on startup and store recent samples for diagnostics.
- Run OS-level NTP/chrony/PTP for better baseline clock accuracy (recommended in production).

Small things I can generate for you right now
- A small Java patch to make TimeSync sample multiple times and pick min-RTT sample.
- A test harness script (Windows .bat) that simulates skewed timestamps and demonstrates LogReorderer behavior.
- A short 1-page note explaining trade-offs between SNTP, PTP, HLC, and vector clocks.

Which of those three should I generate?

      <h3>Member 4 — Consensus & Agreement Algorithms (Expanded)</h3>

          </div>
          <div id="m4-full" class="acc-body">
<pre class="chat">
Goal (plain language)
- Make sure all servers agree on which entries are stored and committed in the payment ledger, and which server is allowed to coordinate writes, even when nodes crash or messages are delayed.

High-level idea
- Use a consensus algorithm so servers elect a leader and replicate a log of changes.
- Leader coordinates appending entries; followers replicate and acknowledge.
- A committed entry is one that a majority (quorum) agrees on — this prevents conflicting histories.
- Leader election and stable commit rules avoid split-brain and ensure correctness under failures.

How the current code implements consensus (simple)
- There is an in-process Raft simulation:
  - RaftNode.java implements election timers, heartbeats, and a simple in-memory log.
  - RaftLogEntry.java models log entries.
  - RaftHarness.java and TestControlPanel are experimental tools / UI to exercise the Raft simulation.
- PaymentServer currently uses ZooKeeper lexicographic znode ordering for leader selection in the production path (simple leader election), not the Raft module.
- The Raft module is useful for learning and tests but is not persisted or integrated with Ledger/ReplicationManager.

Files to open (what to look for)
- RaftNode.java — election timeout, Vote requests, AppendEntries handling.
- RaftLogEntry.java — term, index, command payload.
- RaftHarness.java — harness showing stop/start and message delay simulation.
- PaymentServer.java — where leader is chosen (ZooKeeper) and where integration would be done.
- Ledger.java — commit index and applying entries; where Raft commits would drive apply.

Simple concrete example — leader election + single write
- Start 3 Raft nodes (via harness). Each node:
  - Starts election timeout; one times out and becomes candidate, requests votes.
  - Candidate that wins becomes leader and sends heartbeats.
- Client sends payment command to leader:
  - Leader appends to local Raft log, sends AppendEntries to followers.
  - When a majority append succeeds, leader marks entry committed and applies to Ledger.
  - If leader crashes before commit, a new leader will be elected and incomplete entries are resolved per Raft rules.

Beginner Windows commands you can run (examples)
- Kill a Java process on port 9001:
    for /f "tokens=5" %%a in ('netstat -ano ^| findstr :9001') do taskkill /PID %%a /F

- (If you have a jar) start a server on port 9001:
    java -jar payment-server.jar --port=9001

Simple tests to run (easy)
- Leader election test: start 3 nodes, observe which node becomes leader (logs or harness UI).
- Leader failover: kill the leader, confirm a new leader is elected within election timeout window.
- Log replication test: append entries while one follower is down, bring it back and confirm it catches up.
- Partition test (manual): isolate one node (block its port with firewall) and observe election/commit behavior.

Common limitations in the current prototype
- Raft implementation is in-memory only (no durable log), so leader crashes lose uncommitted log and even committed state across restarts unless Ledger is used.
- Raft is not integrated into the PaymentServer/ReplicationManager; production path uses ZooKeeper leader selection instead.
- Network partitions, message reorder and persistent storage for Raft log are not fully tested.
- No automated stress tests for high throughput or long-term stability.

Practical improvements (ranked from simple → advanced)
1. Persist Raft log and state to disk (term, votedFor, log entries) so nodes survive crashes.
2. Integrate Raft leader + commit index with Ledger.apply / ReplicationManager so Raft becomes the single source of truth.
3. Add leader lease / batching to reduce consensus overhead and increase throughput.
4. Add simulated partitions, message delays, and determinism tests (Jepsen-style) to validate correctness.
5. Use a production Raft library (if acceptable) or keep the in-house implementation but harden it (snapshots, log compaction).

Small things I can generate for you now
- A skeleton patch to persist Raft state (term, votedFor, log entries) to disk (safe minimal changes).
- A small integration sketch that wires Raft commit callbacks to Ledger.apply (Java code stub).
- A Windows .bat script to start 3 nodes and a simple failover test harness that kills the leader and checks logs.

<pre class="chat">
Short answer: This workspace implements a solid prototype that covers large parts of the assignment (fault detection via ZooKeeper, primary-backup replication, deduplication, simple time-sync + log reordering, and a Raft simulation). However it does not fully satisfy all deliverables/requirements for a production-grade submission — gaps remain (consensus is only simulated and not integrated, limited failure/partition testing, no formal report/presentation assets). Below is a concise mapping of what is implemented, what is missing, and concrete next steps per team member.

What is implemented (with links)
- Fault tolerance / membership / failover
  - Node registration and ephemeral membership: `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer` — PaymentServer.java
  - Client discovery + automatic failover: `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentClient` — PaymentClient.java
  - Small watcher helper: `payment.faulttolerance.NodeWatcher` — NodeWatcher.java

- Data replication, deduplication, WAL and ledger
  - Ledger (WAL, ids dedup, commit index, snapshots): `payment.datareplication.Ledger` — Ledger.java
  - Replication RPCs and follower liveness + WAL fetch: `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager` — ReplicationManager.java
  - PaymentServer uses leader-based append + replicate: see leader-path in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer` — PaymentServer.java

- Time synchronization and reordering
  - SNTP-like offset estimator: `payment.timesync.TimeSync` — TimeSync.java
  - Log entry + reorder buffer: `payment.timesync.LogEntry` and `payment.timesync.LogReorderer` — LogEntry.java, LogReorderer.java
  - PaymentServer flushes reordered logs: see scheduled flush in `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer` — PaymentServer.java

- Consensus (simulation / testing UI)
  - In-memory Raft simulation (leader election, heartbeats, log replication) and harness/UI: `payment.consensus.RaftNode`, `payment.consensus.RaftHarness`, `payment.TestControlPanel` — RaftNode.java, RaftHarness.java, TestControlPanel.java

Where the workspace meets the assignment
- Fault detection and failover: ZooKeeper ephemeral nodes + client watchers handle membership and automatic client-side failover.
- Strong-ish consistency and dedup: Leader applies WAL + uses ReplicationManager.replicateAndCount and the `Ledger` uses persistent ids.txt to deduplicate.
- Time sync & reordering: TimeSync + LogReorderer are present and wired into server background tasks.
- Consensus exploration: Raft simulation and UI let you research leader election and behavior under node stop/start.

Major gaps and limitations (what still needs work)
- Consensus is not integrated: The Raft implementation is an in-memory simulation used for experiments/UI. It is NOT wired into the PaymentServer/ReplicationManager/Ledger. Current production flow uses ZooKeeper lexicographic znode leader selection instead of a durable Raft-based replication/commit protocol. See `payment.consensus.RaftNode` — RaftNode.java.
- Durability of consensus log: Raft simulation keeps log in memory; no persistent Raft log or on-disk snapshot.
- Partition/failure testing: No automated tests simulating network partitions, message loss, or Byzantine faults. The harness allows stop/start but not real network partitions.
- Replica catch-up is best-effort and simple: followerCatchup uses WAL fetch but has limited conflict handling and no reconciling policy for divergent WALs.
- Metrics / evaluation missing: No performance measurements (latency, throughput), storage cost analysis or prepared report/presentation files. README documents design but assignment needs a 10–12 page report, slides, and recorded presentation links.
- Security & production concerns: no authentication, TLS, or ZooKeeper ensemble management; single zkConnect assumed.
- Scaling/sharding: system stores full ledger on each node; no sharding implemented (which may be acceptable for prototype but must be justified).
- Tests and automation: No run scripts to bring up multiple servers + zk ensemble automatically.

Concrete next steps by member (minimal changes to reach assignment targets)
- Member 1 (Fault Tolerance)
  - Integrate more robust failure tests: add scripts to start 3 servers + ZooKeeper and automated failure injection (stop process, kill TCP, etc.). Reference: PaymentServer.java.
  - Document and quantify redundancy cost (measure storage of data/server-9001, server-9002 sample files in data/).
  - Add health-check endpoint and improve follower liveness cache in `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager`.

- Member 2 (Data Replication & Consistency)
  - Replace simple synchronous fan-out with a clear quorum policy or integrate Raft commit: either (A) enforce majority quorum everywhere (code already computes needed = total/2+1 but replication currently attempts all followers) or (B) wire Raft to produce committed indices. See `payment.faulttolerance.PaymentServer` and `payment.datareplication.ReplicationManager`.
  - Add unit/integration tests for dedup behavior using current `payment.datareplication.Ledger`.

- Member 3 (Time Sync)
  - Improve TimeSync sampling (multi-sample, min-RTT) and expose configuration; consider Hybrid Logical Clocks if causality needed. See `payment.timesync.TimeSync` and `payment.timesync.LogReorderer`.

- Member 4 (Consensus)
  - Persist Raft log to disk (convert `payment.consensus.RaftNode` to durable implementation), or remove simulation and use an embedded Raft library / integrate with `Ledger`.
  - Integrate leader election and commit decisions into `PaymentServer` instead of ZooKeeper-only leader selection. Example target: leader chosen by Raft becomes the single writer and uses Raft commit index to advance `Ledger.advanceCommitIndex`.

Deliverables checklist vs workspace
- Code prototype: largely there in Java — good. See repository files including README.md.
- Report (10–12 pages): NOT present in workspace — must be written.
- Presentation & video: NOT present.
- GitHub link text file: NOT present.
- Tests & evaluation metrics: Limited / missing.

Verdict
- The current code is a good partial prototype that demonstrates core concepts required by the assignment (fault detection via ZooKeeper, primary-backup replication, dedup, time sync, Raft experimentation). It does not fully satisfy the consensus/agreement deliverable in a provably correct or production-integrated way, and the formal deliverables (report, slides, video) are missing.
- To fully satisfy the assignment, integrate or replace the ad-hoc replication with a durable consensus (or clearly justify the ZooKeeper-based approach + majority quorum), add automated failure/partition tests, produce the written report and slides, and record the presentation.

If you want, I can:
- produce a short patch to wire Raft persistence into the Ledger (skeleton), or
- produce a checklist and minimal test scripts to automate starting 3 servers + ZooKeeper and run failure scenarios.
